##Overview
  This is my delve into the world of OS development. I have been interested in OS development for a while and have learned quite a bit since my frist attempt. With that said I believe I have reached a point where the information I have could be useful to anyone else that is also interested in OS development. I will keep the information here as up to date as I can manage. My motivation was [os-dev.pdf](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf) which I came across in a hackernews post. I found it vastly more straight forward and simple than my previous work sourced from http://osdev.org.
